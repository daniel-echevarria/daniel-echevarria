### What I’m up to lately

- Working on **SleekSpin**, a tool that generates printable record labels using the Discogs API
- Exploring AI-assisted workflows and generative AI integrations.
- Strengthening fundamentals: architecture, data modeling, and performance

---

### How I tend to work

- I think in terms of **products**, not just features
- I prefer **clear and maintainable** solutions over clever ones
- I value calm communication, integrity, and shared ownership

Before focusing fully on software, I worked in creative and technical leadership roles.  
That experience strongly influences how I collaborate today.
