</p>

I’m a **Product Engineer** who enjoys working at the intersection of engineering, design, and real-world constraints.

I like building things that make sense, feel good to use, and hold up over time.

### What I’m up to lately

- Building product-focused web apps with **TypeScript, React, and Next.js**
- Working on **SleekSpin**, a tool that generates printable record labels using the Discogs API
- Exploring AI-assisted workflows and better developer tooling
- Strengthening fundamentals: architecture, data modeling, and performance

---

### A few things I’ve built

I care less about demos and more about projects that solve actual problems.

- **SleekSpin**  
  A real-world app for organizing record collections through printable labels  
  (product UX, APIs, printing constraints)

- **Slick Messenger**  
  A real-time messaging application  
  (authentication, data modeling, backend foundations)

- **Pokememorize**  
  A memory card game built with React and the Pokémon API  
  (state management, performance, clean UI logic)

Pinned repositories contain more context if you’re curious.

### How I tend to work

- I think in terms of **products**, not just features
- I prefer **clear and maintainable** solutions over clever ones
- I value calm communication, integrity, and shared ownership

Before focusing fully on software, I worked in creative and technical leadership roles.  
That experience strongly influences how I collaborate today.

### Tools I enjoy working with

TypeScript · React · Next.js · Node.js · Ruby on Rails · PostgreSQL  
Tailwind CSS · REST APIs · Auth (JWT, Devise) · Docker (learning)
