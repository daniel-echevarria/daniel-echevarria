**Product Engineer**  
**Creative Technologist**

I build thoughtful web products with a strong focus on usability, maintainability, and real-world constraints.  
My background blends engineering, product thinking, and hands-on experience in creative and operational environments.

### How I Work
- **Product-minded**: I care deeply about why we build something, not just how
- **Pragmatic**: clarity and maintainability over clever solutions
- **Collaborative**: calm communication, integrity, and constructive feedback
- **Curious**: I learn fast and enjoy teaching what I’ve understood

I’ve worked in both engineering and leadership roles, including technical direction in a large, horizontal team structure. That experience shaped how I approach ownership, collaboration, and responsibility.
